Learning styles

I have always been a little skeptical about the learning styles that people cling to.
It makes sense for people to have a preference for one learning style over another but,
it doesn't seem like a real problem to anyone that is determined. Even if learning styles did 
matter person to person it is more like a weakness to cling to one style instead of 
accepting it. In fact it would be your acedemic duty to experiment with different ways of learning.
